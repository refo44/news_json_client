When the time came to introduce Sean to her parents, Li's mother immediately saw through her lie, insisting that her daughter's 24-year-old beau was \"too young and good-looking\" to be with her.\nLi and Sean put up a valiant effort to convince Li's mum, and the former admitted to feeling guilty about lying at end of the video. But Li maintained that she's relieved that her folks can worry less about her being single.Two romantic pythons fighting for love on a roof mark breeding seasonDrone captures rare footage of white

Life is often chaotic as each member of the household negotiates for space and attention. It's one of many Australian homes where animals are an integral part of family and domesticity.\nOver the past few months, parents Andrew and John tell us, the dogs have been misbehaving, damaging furniture and belongings while people are at work and school. Andrew has approached the situation by installing webcams and purchasing a pet wearable device called \"Whistle\" for his dog Tigger, a German short-haired pointer who he rightly suspects is the main culprit.\nSEE ALSO: There's a rumour in Japan that pets can see Pok\u00e9mon\nWhistle, according to its website, \"marries GPS tracking and pet wellness in one band.\" Attached to Tigger's collar, it connects to a smartphone app that allows Andrew to track and evaluate Tigger's exercise, play and rest in real time. Whistle is part of a burgeoning pet wearable market that is \"revolutionalising pet health and wellbeing,\" according to one pundit.\u00a0\nWhile at work, Andrew can now keep a \"friendly\" eye on Tigger. He has developed a solution to the dogs' misbehavior that involves locking certain rooms and providing particular play spaces to reflect Tigger's daily rhythms.\n\nOur observations of the Williams family are part of a multi-city research project into domestic practices around digital media, mobile media and games. When we first began our research, we presumed we would focus on human practices and perceptions. But animals kept getting in the way.\nAustralia has one of the highest rates of pet ownership in the world, with nearly five million households including one or more pets. As our work progressed, it became clear that humans and their pets are entangled in various forms of intimacy and kinship, often in digitally mediated ways.\nWe have observed (or heard tales of) cats playing with iPads and keyboards, of dogs watching television or participating in video calls. One of our Perth participants Anna describes how she frequently Skypes with her Blue Heeler Abby (with her partner's help) when she's away on work trips.\nAbby will paw the laptop in anticipation of the evening call when Anna is absent; she gets excited, wags her tail, \"talks\" and presses her nose against the screen. It is quite well known that some dogs \"see\" screens while some don't, Anna says, as she shows us the many YouTube videos people have uploaded of their skyping dogs.\nAs the size of technology shrinks, wearable devices have become hugely popular, from iPods to fitbits. Spurred by the Quantified Self (QS) movement (the use of self-tracking apps and wearables to monitor biometrics and improve daily functioning) and gamification, global shipments of wearable devices are expected to reach 110 million annually by the end of 2016. Pet wearables are now worth A$2.62 billion (US$1.99 billion) a year of this global market and the Australian market is tipped to grow.\n\nPet wearable devices enable surveillance and tracking through devices such as Pod 2, Buddy, W\u00dcF and Nuzzle; monitoring of heart-rate and sleep patterns (Inupathy, PetPace) and may feature geofencing capability and virtual boundary alert systems that let owners know when their pet wanders too far (eg DogTelligent).\nPet owners can \"gamify\" their pet's exercise with a reward system and leaderboard that ranks their results compared to other pets.\u00a0\nThey can download an augmented reality app that sees through obstacles such as furniture to locate their pet. Or they can record and vicariously experience their pet\u2019s perspective and movement remotely via wearable cameras.\nAs we explored Andrew's problem-solving strategies further, it became clear that he had gleaned a complex sense of Tigger's character and behaviour in the home when humans were at work. Andrew explained that particular rooms, couches and beds had different associations for Tigger (for example, he would retreat to the main bedroom when anxious). Through tracking Tigger, he said, he had gained a deeper sense of his pet's moods.\nPet wearables and monitoring systems are also implicated in an ethics of care and surveillance. They originate from a genealogy of care that engages paradoxical notions of constraint and guardianship. Indeed, our relationship with domestic animals is often fraught with ambiguity; pets are both nature and culture, instinctual and social, controlled yet nurtured, at the same time possessions and companions.\nOur kinship with domestic animals is deeply informed by what we might call \"careful surveillance,\" either within the domestic sphere as we observed in the Williams household, or away from home.\nFor instance another study participant, Paul, and his beagle Millie often go for walks together. But Paul told us he worried about Millie wandering off, and so had avoided going for walks at night. Then he purchased a Halo Belt for Millie, which lit up at night. It meant he could always find her in the dark and lessen the chance of her scaring other people in the park, such as night joggers.\u00a0\nThe term \"careful surveillance\" refers to our emotional bond with domestic animals, our protective concern and love for our pets.\u00a0\nBut surveillance must also be a \"careful\" practice, in terms of its effects upon both human and animal. As we increasingly involve our pets in the gamification and quantification of everyday life -- assisted by new technologies -- we should reflect on the relationship between concern and control."},"shares":{"twitter":707,"facebook":152,"linked_in":25,"google_plus":5,"total":889},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/H6KCHo05EBKhArbhvaPFn3aqTCI=/950x534/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F200075%2FGettyImages-658383047.jpg","feature_image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/LqfegdGcDfWxMC2KampjAErxeKw=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19758%2FGettyImages-658383047.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/XdPaq0z0dN6clgPS5_gbJMYgZN0=/175x175/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19758%2FGettyImages-658383047.jpg","query":true,"size":"175x175#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/bUGSPgGhrkaiq_Rcar7wwaaf2eE=/350x350/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19758%2FGettyImages-658383047.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"350x350#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/__kj9z8Cyr6ynsrYWHawVXeGDO4=/80x80/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19758%2FGettyImages-658383047.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"80x80#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/kSnhz_jrjcmEXZWojMoxllq1XJw=/160x160/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19758%2FGettyImages-658383047.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"160x160#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2bXZXis","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"display_title":"Pet wearables are here to help you spy on your four-legged friends","spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{},"excerpt":"Involving our pets in the gamification of everyday life means reflecting on the difference between concern and control.","sponsorship_footer":true,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Pet wearables are here to help you spy on your four-legged friends"},{"_id":"57ccdc686df61269700001c4","id":"2016/09/04/spider-driver-car-fright","title":"Big-ass spider jumps on driver, setting off chain reaction of awful","title_tag":null,"author":"Johnny Lieu","post_date":"2016-09-05T02:45:42+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Mon, 05 Sep 2016 02:45:42 +0000","sort_key":"1BGJUO","link":"http://mashable.com/2016/09/04/spider-driver-car-fright/","content":{"plain":"Arachnophobes, this is your worst nightmare.

Fallin said nobody was seriously hurt by the earthquake and damage was relatively limited.\u00a0\nIn rural Pawnee County, one homeowner suffered minor injuries and three homes were damaged, she said on Twitter. At least six tribal government buildings on the Pawnee Nation's reservation were deemed \"uninhabitable,\" the governor said.\nThe Saturday earthquake was the strongest to rock Oklahoma since November 2011, when a 5.6-magnitude earthquake struck near Prague, a small town roughly 70 miles south of Pawnee.\n\nThe temblor in Prague (pronounced \"PRAY-geh\") was then the strongest in Oklahoma's history. That event and a series of related shocks destroyed more than a dozen homes, injured two people and racked up nearly $1 million in damages across Prague.\nThe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) determined the 2011 quake was most likely triggered by the injection of wastewater from oil and gas operations, including both conventional oil drilling activities and advanced techniques like fracking.\nEnergy companies had injected the wastewater in the ground near a fault zone, setting off a seismic reaction, according to the USGS. The agency declared the event the \"largest human-caused earthquake associated with wastewater injection.\"\n\nSince then, Oklahoma has experienced an exponential number of earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or greater -- meaning ones strong enough for people to feel.\nIn the decades before Oklahoma's drilling boom in 2008, the state saw roughly one to three quakes of that size per year, according to the Oklahoma Geological Survey.\u00a0\nIn 2011, the annual count jumped to 64. By 2013, the state recorded 109 such earthquakes.\u00a0\nLast year, Oklahoma experienced more than 900 earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or greater, the Oklahoma Geological Survey reported. The state has seen hundreds more in 2016.\n\nThe USGS said it was too early to know whether the Pawnee earthquake was caused by industrial human activities.\n\"However, we do know that many earthquakes in Oklahoma have been triggered by wastewater injection fluid,\" the agency said Saturday in a statement. \"The USGS will continue to process seismic data in the following days and weeks that will help answer this question.\"\nIn response to the Sept. 3 earthquake, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, which regulates the state's oil and gas sector, ordered at least 37 injection wells to shut down in the 725-square-mile zone around Pawnee.\nThe schedule for the shutdown: Everything within 5 miles of a 10-mile section of the fault in question is to shut down within 7 days.\u2014 Governor Mary Fallin (@GovMaryFallin) September 3, 2016\n\nOklahoma isn't the only state to experience \"induced seismicity\" -- aka human-caused earthquakes -- as a result of oil and gas wastewater injections.\nThe USGS estimated in March that around 7 million people live and work in areas of the central and eastern United States with potential for damaging shaking from induced earthquakes\n\nSix states bear the brunt of those potential hazards, the federal agency said. In order from highest to lowest potential hazard, they are: Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico and Arkansas.\nThe USGS report was the first time the agency identified the potential ground-shaking hazards from both human-induced and natural earthquakes -- a move that reflects the rising significance of induced earthquakes from wastewater injections.\nUSGS scientists found 21 areas with increased rates of induced seismicity, including within small areas of Alabama and Ohio."},"shares":{"facebook":102,"google_plus":7,"linked_in":10,"twitter":641,"total":760},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Yhb744eGZUgzViU2We6enDNzoAc=/950x534/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F199981%2FGettyImages-471406230.jpg","feature_image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/aw_SZfAG6HJsDTCy7MEJ3_wGACg=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19734%2FGettyImages-471406230.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/J15_4eUG8fQK4RIH9uRH_1YIxqo=/175x175/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19734%2FGettyImages-471406230.jpg","query":true,"size":"175x175#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/k6WrFZON_ldctCRM7atA9U_JRcE=/350x350/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19734%2FGettyImages-471406230.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"350x350#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/9iazZvLCbL8dFRDkxT4jvS5UBcU=/80x80/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19734%2FGettyImages-471406230.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"80x80#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/stuIlYeIfVLRPnGuQaCikMynsas=/160x160/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19734%2FGettyImages-471406230.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"160x160#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2bMUSyd","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"display_title":"Oklahoma's magnitude 5.6 quake comes amid concerns around oil and gas boom","spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{},"excerpt":"The Sept. 3 temblor is one of thousands to strike the state in recent years as energy companies keep injecting wastewater deep underground.","sponsorship_footer":true,"channel":"World","channel_label":"World","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/world/","tweet_text":"Oklahoma's magnitude 5.6 quake comes amid concerns around oil and gas boom"}],"rising":[{"_id":"57cd2896f11b2c106800076e","id":"2016/09/05/karl-stefanovic-award-apology","title":"TV host's award nomination for transphobic slur apology attracts backlash","title_tag":null,"author":"Johnny Lieu","post_date":"2016-09-05T08:10:45+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Mon, 05 Sep 2016 08:10:45 +0000","sort_key":"1BGPZN","link":"http://mashable.com/2016/09/05/karl-stefanovic-award-apology/","content":{"plain":"The Honour Awards acknowledge those who have made contributions to the LGBTQ community in Australia, and the organisation behind them, Aurora Group, announced on Monday that The Today Show's Karl Stefanovic is a finalist in the media category.\u00a0\nWhy?

The note was a thank you to his parents.\n\"Probably one of the most unfortunate things in a 'Bloke's Life' [sic] is that it takes over 30 years to realise how essential you have been to build my character, my ethics and, most importantly, my HAPPINESS,\" Steve wrote.\n\"At 32, I am finally starting to figure it out. In good times and in bad, you were there. Your strength and endurance to raise me will not go unrewarded.

They may not necessarily do that in any organized way; more likely they\u2019re out there in all this wild wind and when they chance into the calm of the eye they may make an effort to stay there and travel with it rather than fighting the winds again.\n\nWhen the storm reaches land, some of them may start fighting the winds. Others may go with it and travel with the eye until the hurricane dissipates. The majority of seabirds, if they are not too weakened from having flown for so long without food, will probably find their way back to shore quickly. They have great powers of navigation.\nPost-Tropical Cyclone Hermine isn't projected to make landfall again as it continues its slow, erratic movements off the Atlantic coast, although the storm may still cause flooding and storm surge in the mid-Atlantic and southern New England states, the National Hurricane Center (NCH) said on Sunday.\nHermine has intensified some on Sunday, the NCH also reported, with maximum sustained winds of up to 70 miles per hour."},"shares":{"twitter":962,"facebook":142,"linked_in":10,"google_plus":8,"total":1122},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/AH3-xSXZ8XPUQqmOCg0e3Z4eXxg=/950x534/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F199826%2F127a2dbf1d22479a8112a6319c9c090b.jpg","feature_image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/AL1qyiy5ABccthYQPvA072G_LFU=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19724%2F127a2dbf1d22479a8112a6319c9c090b.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/6GPV6tvut4mdFF9RMZdXBHKDin8=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19724%2F127a2dbf1d22479a8112a6319c9c090b.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/iSAQk6Iw0OtME3-dL-qeuvGF01s=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19724%2F127a2dbf1d22479a8112a6319c9c090b.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/CHCvNXMUrTHx2IfmReDZ5yOoMxw=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19724%2F127a2dbf1d22479a8112a6319c9c090b.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/_9qiZr6uAg8OMYGsKqFFLGjSgsE=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19724%2F127a2dbf1d22479a8112a6319c9c090b.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2bMsWdG","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"display_title":"Radar captures flock of seabirds trapped in the eye of Hermine","spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{},"velocity":[1000,999],"show_sponsorship":true,"channel":"World","channel_label":"World","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/world/","tweet_text":"Radar captures flock of seabirds trapped in the eye of Hermine"},{"_id":"57cc0cc19111ae2b51001712","id":"2016/09/04/american-tourists-cuba","title":"What an influx of American tourists could mean for Cuba","title_tag":null,"author":"Tim Chester","post_date":"2016-09-04T12:00:00+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Sun, 04 Sep 2016 12:00:00 +0000","sort_key":"1BGChV","link":"http://mashable.com/2016/09/04/american-tourists-cuba/","content":{"plain":"When JetBlue Flight 387 touched tarmac Wednesday, it marked a historic moment for the U.S. and Cuba.\nThe plane from Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, to Santa Clara was the first commercial flight between the two countries in more than half a century, and it heralded a new era of American tourism in the Caribbean nation.\nSEE ALSO: First commercial flight from U.S. to Cuba in 50 years takes off\nVisitors from the U.S. have 12 ways to justify a trip to the country (including visiting relatives, taking part in academic programs or participating in journalistic or religious activities) and soon there will be six carriers offering 110 flights daily to nine Cuban cities.\nAfter years of Canadians and Europeans enjoying the delights of Cuba, Americans will gradually get to visit en masse too. 91,000 people from the U.S. traveled to Cuba in 2014. By 2015 that figure was 150,000 and it's projected to grow to 1.5 million annually.\nThe potential influx of U.S. visitors poses several questions though.\nFirstly, is Cuba ready? Travel expert Peter Greenberg thinks not. He pointed out on CBS Wednesday that the country only has 60,000 hotel rooms and they're full of visitors from other countries. That woeful figure is emblematic of an unprepared tourism infrastructure, he added, with Wi-Fi, bathrooms, transportation and computer terminals for credit card payments among the aspects that will need to upgrade fast.\nThe fact that the first flight was to Santa Clara and not Havana was telling too, he said, adding that the Cuban government is splitting the new flights between nine airports as there isn't one hub that can take the increased air traffic.\nWhile cruise ships have been docking in Cuba's ports in increased numbers since Obama restored diplomatic relations in 2014 and travel restrictions have eased, those boats offer beds and meals to their guests. Tourists coming off planes will be on their own.\nThe finite number of hotel rooms and limited tourist services will mean demand may soon exceed supply and you don't need an economics degree to work out what that will mean for your holiday money.\nAirbnb is offering some respite. The company launched in Cuba in April 2015 with 1,000 listings, building on an existing slice of capitalism in the country that saw residents offering home stays or casas particulares to travelers. That figure now exceeds 8,000, the company told Mashable.\n\nSecondly, though, and perhaps more importantly: What will the growing number of U.S. tourists in Cuba mean for the country itself?\nWill an influx in visitors from the north herald an era of Americanization in which cheap chicken shops chase away the arroz con pollo joints and the ghost of Hemingway disappears in a steam of skinny lattes?\nIt crossed many minds when diplomatic relations began to thaw.\nI really hope I can make it to #Cuba before McDonald's, Starbucks, etc.\u2014 Matt Bradley (@MattMcBradley) December 17, 2014\n\n54,599 people making the same penetrating insight https://t.co/Y0E21l5NSI\u2014 Michael C Moynihan (@mcmoynihan) December 17, 2014\n\nGoodbye Cuba...hello Ameri-ba after Mcdonalds and Wal-Mart ruin it... https://t.co/hjjGWNYbfV\u2014 Michael X (@_michaelx) September 2, 2016\n\nQuiero conocer #Cuba antes de que haya un #McDonalds .\u2014 Daniel H P\u00e9rez (@danieleplay) September 1, 2016\n\nHugh Riley, secretary general and CEO of the Caribbean Tourist Organization voiced similar concerns. \"When visitors arrive and they stay and they invest and buy property, they bring with them elements of their own culture,\" he said. \"Is a culture ever impervious to influences from external sources? The answer is an unequivocal no.\"\nOf course, many of those curious first travelers keen for a more authentic experience will inadvertently precipitate in the problem. And while the tourist floodgates are slowly creaking open, U.S. businesses are certainly surveying the untapped market with glee.\nMany of those curious first travelers keen for a more authentic experience will inadvertently precipitate the problem.\nStarwood Hotels & Resorts, the massive multinational with 1,300 properties in some 100 countries, signed three hotel deals in March. The agreement means several state-run hotels will become Starwood stays; in Havana the Hotel Inglaterra will be part of Starwood's Luxury Collection Brand while the Hotel Quinta Avenida will become a Four Points by Sheraton. Marriott's CEO accompanied Obama on his spring trip too.\u00a0\nMany corporate eyes are watching the island; a U.S. plastics delegation, for example, explored options in April. Economist Bill Wood told an industry website: \u201cHaving to serve tourists is going to be a great thing. Any time there\u2019s commerce, we know that plastics can\u2019t be far behind.\u201d\nJaime Suchlicki, director of the Institute of Cuban and Cuban American Studies at the University of Miami, told Mashable he thinks the threat from more tourism is overblown. \"For the past decade, several million tourists from Latin America, Canada and Spain have visited Cuba, many that speak Spanish. Very little impact,\" he said.\n\"Tourists do not change a society. \u00a0Communism collapsed in Eastern Europe 10 years after tourism stopped. If we believe that tourism can change totalitarian societies, we should send tourists to North Korea and Iran.\"\n\nA more pressing concern, Suchlicki believes, is the fact that tourists' money ends up in the pocket of the military via government-run hotels and restaurants.\n\"A portion of the tourists' expenditure in Cuba supports the regime and in particular the Cuban military,\" he said. \u201cVisitors should hope to influence Cuban society politically and culturally and so on. Visits as tourists alone should be avoided.\u201d\nLuke Waterson, a freelance travel writer who specializes in the Caribbean, told Mashable that American tourism and investment was vital for the country.\n\"Visitors should hope to influence Cuban society politically and culturally.\"\n\"Anything which improves Cuban quality of life towards the standards many of us take for granted is an immensely positive progression,\" he said. \"Cuba's culture is massively complex: There is an already entrenched American influence, but also an African, a Spanish, a Caribbean.\"\n\"Cuba's economic outlook, without overseas trade or investment, or without foreign tourism, would be very, very bleak. It is hard to see how such a strong, rich culture could be overly damaged by an influx of North American tourists and it is hard to see how the economy could be anything other than boosted. Of course, it remains to be seen how long it will take for Cubans in the remoter, less-touristy parts of the country to see the resultant benefits, but I believe these will come in time.\"\u00a0\nGreenberg suggests Americans interested in Cuba wait 18 months to give the nation time to prepare for the influx of visitors and visit some of the other Caribbean islands in the meantime. They'll be suffering from a lack of business and operators will be cutting prices. Islands in the Caribbean see some 70% of their tourism come from the U.S. and places like the Bahamas and Jamaica could be hard hit by the increased interest in Cuba.\nWhether anyone will be able to resist the charms of the island for that long, however, remains to be seen."},"shares":{"google_plus":12,"facebook":542,"twitter":846,"linked_in":26,"total":1426},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/K1HMAUIfU7gLM17ww4DWrRnNjVg=/950x534/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F198259%2FGettyImages-527247252.jpg","feature_image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Kp8VU0n10xxIXBY3-OVMPpWka_s=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19425%2FGettyImages-527247252.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/sioxHDedUnzbv7W8_uwJ5W6jYxo=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19425%2FGettyImages-527247252.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/RiwT3u5TTLlb-NUuWQpu8ame3RA=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19425%2FGettyImages-527247252.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/hCJdySl9lDuQ3Z_o7A3dMom2r54=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19425%2FGettyImages-527247252.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/dOJyB7pIuSvUIbncNq1i9ER1C3c=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19425%2FGettyImages-527247252.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2c5WUd4","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"display_title":"What an influx of American tourists could mean for Cuba","spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{},"velocity":[930,919,996,1000,955,944,935,889,890,885,880,877,874,869,856,848,846,839],"show_sponsorship":true,"channel":"World","channel_label":"World","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/world/","tweet_text":"What an influx of American tourists could mean for Cuba"},{"_id":"57cc40146df61213020014b9","id":"2016/09/04/ifa-2016-wrap-up","title":"At IFA 2016, smart appliances and virtual reality take center stage","title_tag":null,"author":"Stan Schroeder","post_date":"2016-09-04T15:38:12+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Sun, 04 Sep 2016 15:38:12 +0000","sort_key":"1BGAtG","link":"http://mashable.com/2016/09/04/ifa-2016-wrap-up/","content":{"plain":"BERLIN -- Coming to Berlin for the 2016 IFA electronics trade show, we expected wearables, smart everything and virtual reality devices, and that's pretty much exactly what we got.\u00a0\nStill, seeing all the \"smart\" and \"connected\" home appliances in one place gave me a sense of how much this technology will permeate our everyday lives in a few years.\u00a0\nSEE ALSO: LG built a huge tunnel out of OLED TVs, and it\u2019s epic\nSmart iron? Check. Smart toothbrush? Check. Smart fridge that takes photos of its contents with three cameras and then sends it to your phone every hour so you always know what's inside? Check.\u00a0\nWhile that last one might sound like something I made up, it's an actual Samsung product, originally unveiled in May 2016. Besides spying on the fridge's contents, the Family Hub wants you to use it to do all sorts of things: shop for groceries, watch TV, write and share notes.\u00a0\n\nAnd a connected iron prototype, presented at IFA by the Swiss company Laurastar (top photo), has an accompanying app that gives you the iron's vital stats, and even teaches you how to iron properly.\u00a0\nWe've seen smart gadgets before. But each year, they get refined with new features, sometimes preposterous; a new Acer pet camera, for example, lets a group of eight people play with a pet. At the other end of the \"smart home\" spectrum, features get automated. A Philips motion sensor turns your smart light on automatically as soon as you enter the room; no need to do anything, it just works. And a Sony projector turns any surface of your house into a touchscreen.\nIf it sounds like overkill, it is; but once the price point on such devices drops to the point where everyone can afford them, the non-smart appliances could simply fade into the background to make way for the new, connected ones.\u00a0\nPut on your VR headset, time for a massage\nThe somewhat utilitarian nature of IFA -- you wouldn't believe the amount of enterprise-grade air purifiers and washing machines we've seen here -- is good for assessing how, exactly, upcoming technologies will affect our everyday lives. At any other electronics show, pretty much every VR headset you see will be tethered to some sort of gaming computer; here at IFA, the virtual/augmented reality helps you ease into a massage or pick up the right package in a warehouse.\u00a0\nThere were a few surprises as well; Alcatel launching a standalone VR headset (meaning it's not tethered to a computer or a phone) unexpectedly put the Chinese electronics maker on the VR map.\u00a0\nBut despite all the headsets we've seen in Berlin, I still can't shake the feeling that what we're seeing now is just an early prototype stage for a vastly more refined VR experience that'll arrive in the future. The world's first (in terms of actually shipping, an XMG rep told me) VR-ready backpack computer works well, but looks amazingly clunky. You would not want to be seen with this thing anywhere; my colleague Ray (see photo below) had no choice.\u00a0\n\nSo when will VR crawl out of the gaming niche and truly become something everyone can use for leisure and entertainment? It might take a generation or three; a lot of these devices are still too big, too hot and too bulky for my taste. Once you're able to put on your headset and forget about it, as you do with your glasses, it'll be a different ball game. The push behind VR is so strong -- Facebook, Samsung, Google, and even Apple (which doesn't have a VR product yet) swear by it -- that you'll see a lot more of it in the next couple of years.\u00a0\nOLED gets cheap; smartwatches start looking like regular watches\nBig screens on fridges and VR headsets aside, we (unsurprisingly) saw plenty of regular TV screens in Berlin, and guess what: they were mostly OLED 4K screens.\u00a0\nIn fact, LG had built an entire tunnel out of those screens, and in the booths of companies such as Samsung, Sony and Panasonic, the large OLED 4Ks got the most prominent placement.\u00a0\nBut the fact that OLED TVs are great-looking and thin is not new. What's new is that the price is finally coming down to make them a viable replacement for your LCD. Perhaps $55,000 for a 98-inch, 8K OLED TV doesn't sound cheap, but such devices easily cost twice that amount a year ago.\u00a0\nWrapping up this year's IFA, two more things need to be mentioned, even though they felt like an afterthought: wearables and smartphones. There was a lot of smartwatches at the show, with Samsung's huge Gear S3 leading the way, and if there's one trend I've noticed, it's the tendency to make these look like analog watches. Samsung did not hide this intention when it presented the Gear S3, especially its Classic variant. Withings also launched an elegant fitness watch.\u00a0\n\nPerhaps the most interesting take on that idea was an upcoming watch from the Fossil-owned, Danish brand Skagen -- a smartwatch that looks exactly like an analog watch, notifying you of messages, emails and meetings with vibration and various (customizable) movements of its hands.\u00a0\nAs for phones, we didn't see that many new ones, save for some solid mid-rangers from Huawei and ZTE, and that's probably a good thing. Within days, Apple will show its new iPhone 7, and any flagship shown at IFA would likely be all but forgotten.\u00a0"},"shares":{"twitter":1201,"linked_in":54,"facebook":226,"google_plus":18,"total":1499},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Hoha8tzYCYR_CT4wP6rtnfQOs38=/950x534/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F199448%2F1.jpg","feature_image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/LZhTywi6azO7v6Umw7mVs3laOXE=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19696%2F1.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/z5v195ukO9VmQ7eGS47Vgfy9nPY=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19696%2F1.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/HxPKHgAkllkvzEIvyWix8XgxT0M=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19696%2F1.jpg","query":"(min-resolution:

being criminalised across Australia.\u00a0\nPunishing those who share explicit pictures without consent is a welcome development, but commentators say any crackdown ought to be accompanied by another look at how the law treats young people who share intimate images with their peers.\u00a0\nIf no change is made, child pornography laws that are intended to protect young people could instead be used to punish normal teenage behaviour.\nSEE ALSO: Teen boys are 'abusing' girls online. But how do we talk about it?\nOn Monday, the state of New South Wales (NSW) announced it would follow Victoria and South Australia in introducing a law criminalising the distribution of intimate or explicit images without consent. \"These images can ... be used as a way to deliberately humiliate, control or harass the intended victim,\" NSW Attorney General Gabrielle Upton said in a statement.\nA federal senate committee also recommended revenge porn laws be enacted nationally in February, but a law is yet to be proposed.\nNSW will begin a consultation process about the proposed change, and one important question to be answered, Upton noted, is how it should treat young people.\u00a0\nKatie Acheson, CEO of youth advocacy group Youth Action, welcomed NSW's announcement, including the proposed focus on young people. \"Young people should be at the centre of this,\" she told Mashable. \"It's about a young person's safety, and also about their healthy development.\"\nToo often, the public has reflexively treated revenge porn and \"sexting\" as two sides of the same coin when it comes to people under 18. The consensual and non-consensual sharing of intimate pictures by teenagers are often regarded as equally suspect.\nThat attitude, as well as a slow-moving legal system, has led to a situation where young people are at risk of becoming registered sex offenders under child pornography laws for sharing intimate imagery without harm. While there are few example of the law's use against teenagers, the threat is still on the books.\n\"Child pornography laws are there to keep young people safe, not to be used to harm them,\" Acheson emphasised. In her view, NSW's revenge porn law should be accompanied by a change to NSW's child pornography laws to ensure young people aren't punished for consensual behaviour.\n\"Humans always use their surroundings to express themselves, including their sexuality. The idea that technology isn't going to be a part of that is a bit behind the times,\" she explained. \"We need to have laws that don't penalise young people for acting in an consensual way, but we would want to deter them from doing something that would harm others.\"\nVictoria leads the way\nVictoria is one of the only states in Australia that has so far tried to do things differently. While it's an offence in the state to share an intimate image of another person without consent, it's also changed child pornography laws to try and ensure young people are not unfairly ensnared.\nFrom 2014 in Victoria, young people cannot be prosecuted for child pornography offences, so long as the photo shared was of themselves, or if the person receiving the image was under 18 and the person in the photo was no more than two years younger than the person receiving it.\nNicola Henry, a senior lecturer at La Trobe University in Melbourne who has studied revenge porn, told Mashable Australia other states should follow suit.\n\"Other states and territories haven't amended the legislation,\" Henry said. \"It means a young person could be charged with child pornography offences for taking an image of themselves, storing it on their phone and sharing it consensually.\"\n\"Rehabilitation ought to be the focus.\"\nDealing with the sharing of explicit images online without consent is a similarly complicated matter, and parties will need to be careful about criminalising young people under laws like the one proposed in NSW.\n\"Rehabilitation ought to be the focus,\" youth crime program manager at Legal Aid Victoria, Anoushka Jeronimus, told Mashable. \"In relation to young people, regardless of the nature of the offending, you always need to look at that offender as a young person, and they, as far as possible, need to be treated differently to adults.\"\nIn Henry's view, more education is also vital for teaching young people about the effects of sharing images without consent -- something that could take place through primary prevention initiatives in schools, including \"respectful relationships\" education.\u00a0\n\"We have to come to terms with the fact that this is what young people are doing, and not just young people, but people in intimate relationships are using technology as a tool of flirtation or sexual desire,\" Henry added. \"We need to focus the attention away from the victim and onto the perpetrator. These images are not theirs to share.\"\nThe NSW Department of Justice has been contacted by Mashable for comment."},"shares":{"facebook":248,"twitter":1765,"linked_in":61,"google_plus":20,"total":2094},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/uqPuwbmvn8F4w54YZD4o3HmbFlM=/950x534/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F200179%2F295e63ce029841c2954954ad1cee6b91.jpg","feature_image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Fvkx8hU5X_jQEAPgeBwRQXKKKTY=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19755%2F295e63ce029841c2954954ad1cee6b91.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/mPX1goob0FXLrqU8knyNwSWZ0b8=/638x368/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19755%2F295e63ce029841c2954954ad1cee6b91.jpg","query":true,"size":"638x368#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ixgvaU6CX2w7uD9aIIy5b1nXYNk=/1276x736/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19755%2F295e63ce029841c2954954ad1cee6b91.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"1276x736#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/wQZb-CeZo6CQBWoPNfXrkYv6vlU=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19755%2F295e63ce029841c2954954ad1cee6b91.jpg","query":"(max-width: 1160px)","size":"356x205#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/OI4AFZu96Fk7cefojjO75RlMKlo=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19755%2F295e63ce029841c2954954ad1cee6b91.jpg","query":"(max-width: 1160px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/wWKS9cg86WB3LqhjThJlTrKKYf0=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19755%2F295e63ce029841c2954954ad1cee6b91.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/GuYcwCte2h1K9I0EwMFoWaUlNtM=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19755%2F295e63ce029841c2954954ad1cee6b91.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2c1c2E9","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"display_title":"Australia is taking on revenge porn, but young people are still at risk","spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{},"excerpt":"\"We need to focus the attention away from the victim and onto the perpetrator.\"","show_sponsorship":true,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Australia is taking on revenge porn, but young people are still at risk"},{"_id":"57ccfdb09111ae5c63000253","id":"2016/09/05/millenials-vs-boomers-twitter","title":"Millennials respond excellently to #HowToConfuseAMillennial hashtag","title_tag":null,"author":"Elise Cooper","post_date":"2016-09-05T05:07:22+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Mon, 05 Sep 2016 05:07:22 +0000","sort_key":"1BGMDK","link":"http://mashable.com/2016/09/05/millenials-vs-boomers-twitter/","content":{"plain":"Well, it happened.

It was a little nod to Kaepernick and everything that he\u2019s standing for right now.\"\nAddressing the need for deeper conversations on race in the country, Rapinoe also compared it to her experience being gay: \"Being a gay American, I know what it means to look at the flag and not have it protect all of your liberties.\"\nShe says she intends to keep kneeling during the anthem and, later, in an interaction with journalist and activist Shaun King on Twitter, she said she wanted to \"keep the conversation going.\"\nI actually think what @mPinoe did tonight was HUGE.

And we were talking to him about how can we get the message back on track and not take away from the military, not take away from pride in our country, but keep the focus on what the issues really are. As we talked about it, we came up with taking a knee because there are issues that still need to be addressed and there was also a way to show more respect for the men and women that fight for this country.\nWhile Kaepernick has received much criticism for his protest, he's also seen a wave of support, including from veterans who shared their support across social media.\u00a0"},"shares":{"facebook":314,"twitter":956,"google_plus":6,"linked_in":18,"total":1294},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/xIo5--MXjlkfdqepKSdG3DZfK-8=/950x534/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F200176%2Fed891f1d7b21461e8139b5f98cded442.jpg","feature_image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/zNzYoXCOolC7DanMqUZ2Z7iXUWQ=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19765%2Fed891f1d7b21461e8139b5f98cded442.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/DYn2awAU7N1oTUmLPUXvLFZa1OU=/638x368/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19765%2Fed891f1d7b21461e8139b5f98cded442.jpg","query":true,"size":"638x368#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/SiCME9juw9r3Na1Y_2FpOQUxpRc=/1276x736/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19765%2Fed891f1d7b21461e8139b5f98cded442.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"1276x736#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/H7TOs0UD5P_eCTebWNjDjH_xX9A=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19765%2Fed891f1d7b21461e8139b5f98cded442.jpg","query":"(max-width: 1160px)","size":"356x205#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/P2tHKncLl7KjszoI2AsuK1_p4ew=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19765%2Fed891f1d7b21461e8139b5f98cded442.jpg","query":"(max-width: 1160px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/9T9HnSTs5rFC7Vr3b9MISZBQvbI=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19765%2Fed891f1d7b21461e8139b5f98cded442.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/8KMC7EtPG6rtYjUsVxkHEuZBou4=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F19765%2Fed891f1d7b21461e8139b5f98cded442.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2bN9KfN","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"display_title":"Megan Rapinoe kneels during anthem in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick","spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{},"excerpt":"Rapinoe is one of the first non-NFL pro athletes to make such a public stand in line with Kaepernick's recent protests.","show_sponsorship":true,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Sports","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/sports/","tweet_text":"Megan Rapinoe kneels during anthem in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick"},{"_id":"57cce0286df61269700001d4","id":"2016/09/04/singapore-couple-opens-home-zika","title":"A Singaporean couple is offering to house pregnant women who live in Zika hotzones","title_tag":null,"author":"Victoria Ho","post_date":"2016-09-05T03:01:33+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Mon, 05 Sep 2016 03:01:33 +0000","sort_key":"1BGKQn","link":"http://mashable.com/2016/09/04/singapore-couple-opens-home-zika/","content":{"plain":"UPDATE: Sept. 5, 2016, 12:12 p.m. SGT Updated with response from Leonie Francesca.\nSINGAPORE -- A Singaporean couple has opened their home to pregnant women living in Zika hotzones who are afraid they might get infected by the virus.\nIn a Facebook post, Leonie Francesca said she and her husband, Justin Besson, are offering a room in their apartment to pregnant women keen to seek refuge from Zika-carrying mosquitos.\n\nSEE ALSO: Returning Olympians warned to practice safe sex due to Zika fears\nThe Bessons live on the 13th floor in Pasir Ris, east of the areas that have logged the highest incidence of the virus that has been linked to microcephaly, a birth defect that results in babies with smaller than average heads due to abnormal brain development.\nFrancesca is a teacher, and Besson is listed on his Facebook profile as a freelance motion graphic designer. The couple have an 11-month-old boy.\nFor now, no one has come forward yet to ask about the room, she told Mashable. \"Maybe it's too far from the city?\" she said.\nShe added that she hopes the community will rise up during this period, \"instead of selfishly clearing repellent stocks they obviously won't use till next month -- or reselling it for marked up prices.\"\nShe was quoted by Today saying: \"I was just imagining what pregnant women feel right now, and I had this idea.

First, there was a tiff over stairs. More specifically, there were no stairs for Obama to use to disembark from Air Force One, according to the Washington Post. The logistical issue sent aides scrambling and forced Obama to exit the plane from a rear door.\n\nMeanwhile, on the ground, Chinese officials got into a confrontation with American journalists and photographers who were trying to take up positions to capture Obama's arrival. Except the Chinese officials wanted to keep the journalists far back from the plane.\u00a0\nThat led to a few testy moments, caught on camera by Reuters' White House reporter Roberta Rampton. When a reporter seems to express her right to be in the location, the official responds, \"This is our country, this is our airport.\"\u00a0\nGovernment official was not happy that reporters were under the wing of AF1.

And part of the reason is because we insist on a certain approach to our press pool, for example, that other countries may not insist on.\"\n\nAnd, yet, it still didn't sit well with some.\u00a0\nThe Defense Intelligence Agency, an agency at the Pentagon specializing in military intelligence, tweeted out the below salty statement, calling out China, before quickly deleting it.\nDefense Intelligence Agency bringing the snark to China (screenshot in case it gets deleted) pic.twitter.com/N7a8OHbuly\u2014 Chris Brigham (@CJBrigham) September 3, 2016\n\nWhile it was deleted, it didn't go unnoticed.\u00a0\n\nThe guy or gal who runs @DefenseIntel's Twitter feed over the weekend needs a medal & a raise right now https://t.co/gbVvRT1ELH\u2014 Aki Peritz (@AkiPeritz) September 4, 2016\n\nPretty sure the DIA did not mean to tweet this. https://t.co/6cEvz14LhY\u2014 Eric Geller (@ericgeller) September 3, 2016\n\nAll the attention later prompted the DIA to tweet an apology about the snark.\nEarlier today, a tweet regarding a news article was mistakenly posted from this account & does not represent the views of DIA.

You're no longer considered an endangered species.\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) on Sunday moved the black-eared, white-faced bears from \"endangered\" to \"vulnerable\" on its Red List of Threatened Species.\nBut eastern gorillas, the world's largest living primate, have little reason to celebrate.\u00a0\nThe ape species is now listed as \"critically endangered,\" the last step before an animal is considered extinct, the IUCN said during its World Conservation Congress in Hawaii.\nSEE ALSO: Greenland sharks could be the world's longest-living vertebrates\nThe conservation union cited illegal hunting as it downgraded the eastern gorilla's status on its global list, which contains more than 80,000 species -- roughly one-third of which are threatened with extinction.\n\nOnly an estimated 5,000 eastern gorillas remain in the forests of the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, southwestern Uganda and Rwanda, the IUCN said. That's a roughly 70-percent decline over the past two decades.\n\"To see the eastern gorilla \u2014 one of our closest cousins \u2014 slide toward extinction is truly distressing,\" Inger Andersen, IUCN director general, said in a statement.\u00a0\n\"Conservation action does work and we have increasing evidence of it. It is our responsibility to enhance our efforts to turn the tide and protect the future of our planet,\" she added.\n\nCase in point: the giant panda.\nThe IUCN said the giant panda population rose by 17 percent to 1,864 adults in the decade up to 2014. Adding cubs to the projection would mean roughly 2,060 giant pandas exist today, according to the conservation union.\nThe improvement follows decades of conservation work in China, including intensive efforts by the Chinese government to replant bamboo forests -- the bears' main source of food and shelter -- and launch captive breeding programs and partnerships with zoos.\nBreaking news!

The comic -- who had already been a high-profile target for internet-fueled harassment -- had her personal website and iCloud account hacked, with the perpetrators of the crime posting a mix of personal information and nude photos.\nAfter the hack, Jones stepped away from social media temporarily. It was in some ways a repeat of what happened in July after racist trolls targeted her following the release of Ghostbusters.\u00a0\nA modicum of good came from that first incident, at least: conservative voice and self-described troll Milo Yiannopoulos was banned from Twitter for his role in inciting the virtual hate mob.\nJones addressed her second return to social media in a pair of Sunday tweets.\nThanks to my fans and friends!
